# Pigeon

### Twitter iPhone app developed using PhoneGap framework

Pigeon is a demo app for the PhoneGap framework, showing how to use PhoneGap to make that most common of mobile applications, a simple Twitter client. Pigeon authenticates your Twitter credentials and then displays all of the tweets from users you're following. You can post a new tweet (Pigeon gives a useful beep after you tweet) or select local tweets, which uses PhoneGap's geolocation api to get tweets from nearby.

Pigeon depends on the following projects:

*  [PhoneGap](http://github.com/sintaxi/phonegap/tree/master)
*  [XUI](http://github.com/brianleroux/xui/tree/master)
*  [SQL Store](http://github.com/silentrob/sqlstore/tree/master)
